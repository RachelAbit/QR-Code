### My Process

I create QR Code Clone using basic HTML and CSS by VScode, it is easy for me to create this project since
I have a basic knowledge about CSS display, CSS box model and fonts etc.

### Built with

- CSS Flexbox
- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- Pure HTML and CSS (no frameworks)

### What I learned

I learned that CSS display such as Flexbox and Grid can help me to layout my design and using box model
it's also helpful and important for adding spaces between elements such as images and text inside of my container.

### Continued Development

As I continue learning with HTML and CSS, I want to learn more about CSS frameworks so that I can use it for my future projects. As of now, basic CSS and HTML Im only familiar with but still learning with other concepts.
